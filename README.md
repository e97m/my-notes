## Intro

I am a **mechanical engineer** worked as a *freelance product designer*, and certified as a professional in using SolidWorks (Mechanical design software). To see my work [click here](https://almajdalawi.weebly.com/)
I am fascinated with the IT field, so now I am studying **application development.** Hopefully in the future I could merge mechanical engineering with programming, which is powerful.
