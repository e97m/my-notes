## Intro
<br/>
I am a **mechanical engineer** worked as a *freelance product designer*, and certified as a professional in using SolidWorks (Mechanical design software). To see my work please [click here](https://almajdalawi.weebly.com/).<br/>
I am fascinated with the IT field, so now I am studying **Application Development.** Hopefully in the future I could merge mechanical engineering with programming, which is powerful.
<br/>
I have basic knowledge of the following programming languages:
- Python <br/>
- SQL <br/>
- R <br/>
