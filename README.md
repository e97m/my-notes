## Intro



I am a ***mechanical engineer*** worked as a *freelance product designer*, and certified as a professional in using SolidWorks (Mechanical design software). To see my work please [click here](https://almajdalawi.weebly.com/) .

I am fascinated with the IT field, so now I am studying **Application Development.** Hopefully in the future I could merge mechanical engineering with programming, which is powerful.
 

> I have basic knowledge of the following programming languages: 
>
> - Python 
>
> - SQL 
>
> - R

My planes for now:

- [x] Mechanical Engineering
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Machine Learning
- [ ] Data Bases

In this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/), I found a good article that talks about the skills that every developer must master. Actually, the first advice was touchy and reasonable: programming is to help people not to show off your cleverness. Also do not forget to give the design a fair time, I think I could consider this as a part of helping people.

There were more skills and advice that the article mentions, such as fully understanding the software before starting working on it, this could help simplify your code.

Always think before acting, this will decrease the efforts required for maintaining in the future. Periodic maintenance is an important part of the developing process, don't ignore it.
When you start a new project, good enough is perfect, this will help you build the first version then improve it gradually. 

Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it is really needed. Always try to resist adding more code. Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks, they can work while you are sleeping. 

Code quality is never measured by the number of lines of your code. Usually, the fewer lines the better your code is. You should add logging in at a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save time. 

Do not underestimate the time and effort required to develop a small amount of code or a feature. In the end, this underestimation leads to missing deadlines. Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases, it’s harder to read code than to write it. Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

Keep learning. If you faced a problem search and learn how to solve it, When you have tried everything, and preferably after you have a working solution, now is the best time to seek advice. Look to peers and senior developers to review your code.


Finally, I would like to disagree with the writer on this point "Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”", I know that he is trying to say "make your code readable", but I think this does not prevent commenting everything to make your code clearer.
